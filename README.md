# "Machine Learning in Materials Science" course exercises, instructed by Christopher Kuenneth during the Winter Term 2025 at the University of Bayreuth.


I use [hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) for managing the Python dependencies.

Notes:

- Some notebooks come with buttons to directly run the notebooks in Google Colab
- Run all notebooks in your own VSCode
