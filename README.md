**Computational Materials Science, University of Bayreuth**  



## Overview

Welcome to the exercises for the "Machine Learning in Materials Science" course! Below you'll find relevant instructions, tools, and notes to get started effectively with the coursework.



## Python Dependency Management

This course utilizes [Hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) for managing Python dependencies. Make sure to set up Hatch to easily manage environments and dependencies for working on the exercises.

## Exercises

The exercises are usually provided as Jupyter notebooks in the folder `wt_225_ml_in_ms`.


## Running the Notebooks

You have two primary options to run the provided Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Google Colab**  
   Some notebooks come with a button to launch directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). This is a convenient option if you prefer running notebooks on the cloud.

2. **VSCode**  
   You can also run all notebooks locally using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Ensure you have the necessary extensions installed for a smooth notebook experience.

3. **Coder at Galadriel**  
   You'll get access to Galadriel through Coder during the tutorials and can use it for working on the exercises and your project.



### Notes

---

- The course exercises are designed to be run either in Google Colab or locally on VSCode, depending on your preference.
- Make sure to have the appropriate Python environment set up for running the notebooks.
